# Medical Chatbot (RAG-based)

A medical domain chatbot built with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques.  
This system blends a knowledge retrieval layer (from medical documents or datasets) with a generative LLM to answer health-related user queries with more factual grounding.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a chatbot capable of handling medical questions by combining retrieval of relevant medical content and LLM generation.  
By using a RAG pipeline, the model is less likely to hallucinate and can provide medically grounded answers based on trusted sources.

Key goals:
- Retrieve relevant medical information or documents given a user query  
- Condition a language model with retrieved context to generate better, more accurate responses  
- Build a conversational interface / prototype for medical Q&A  

## Features & Components

- Ingestion of medical documents, papers, or knowledge base (PDFs, articles, structured texts)  
- Indexing / embedding of the knowledge base (vector store, e.g. FAISS, Chroma, or similar)  
- Retrieval engine to fetch relevant passages for a query  
- Prompting / context injection into LLM to generate responses  
- Chatbot interface (notebook, Gradio, Streamlit, or API)  
- Fallback / safety logic (limits, disclaimers, out-of-domain handling)
